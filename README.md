### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome and thanks for stopping by. I am Nirzaree, a data scientist based in India. I have over 9 years of experience in writing data driven and machine learning algorithms for embedded devices in the areas of wearable tech, electric mobility and agriculture. 

My areas of interest are machine learning, algorithms, sensor design and human computer interaction. 

I enjoy creative technical and scientific problem solving and enjoy it even further if there is a good societal/environmental impact. 

I have a master degree in Embedded Systems from TU, Kaiserslautern, Germany and an undergrad in Electronics Engineering from NIT, Surat, India. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a digital platform to enable natural farming in urban vacant land for better food, climate change mitigation and community building.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborators on this project so please reach out if the idea interests you.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building open source data driven tools for sustainability, Algorithms for embedded devices, designing novel sensing modalities.
- ðŸ’» Python, R, Shiny, AWS.
